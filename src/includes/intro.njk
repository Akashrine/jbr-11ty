    <div class="background__right"><p>Coming from a design and technical background I'm currently working at <a href="https://heetch.com" class="brand-heetch">Heetch</a> as a Senior Product Manager. I'm working on the internal product and on the BtoB part. Before that, I was the CPO of <a href="https://iwd.io/" class="brand-iwd">IWD</a>, and earlier I was lead product manager in E-Commerce at  <a href="https://the-other-store.com/" class="brand-toz">The Other Store</a> for 5 years. As a PM, I love being the link between tech and business, between data and user in order to provide well designed features. <br />Father of 2-year-old-kid Lucas, I'm spending my free time surfing 🏄 from lego to playmobil to Paw Patrol 🐶.</p></div>

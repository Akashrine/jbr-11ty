<p class="lead">Who am I kidding? Launching a website is hard, launching <em>your</em> website is worse. Launching it in 2020 when you're already 35 years old, a dad and 2 loans to pay off - needless to say we're flirting with insanity. But there are reasons!</p>


## Back online

Okay, this is my first motivation to relaunch my website. It's now been 12 years since the last time I've been "online", everything has changed a lot but that's part of the fun : __Adaptation__ üí™.

The last time I was online it was because I needed it. I was launching my freelance business with less than 6 months of experience and only 2 or 3 "contacts". Needless to say the portfolio was a mandatory element!

Now I'm not a web designer anymore, I've made small changes after small changes to become a [Product Manager](https://linkedin.com/in/julienbrionne). I'll talk about it one day. So the idea is to be back online once again and share my thoughts.

## Experiment with code again

In order to go back online I had to start coding again and even if it was harder than expected, I had a lot of fun while doing this site. It is obviously not over and we can clearly say that it's more of an <abbr data-tooltip title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> than a final version but, as I'd like to go further in development, I'm keeping this site as a great place to experiment (and obviously fail a lot).

## Writing ... in english

Even if I'm working in English every day and feeling confident talking in English, when it comes to writing longer posts I lack vocabulary, and I globally suck at using the right tense. As I want to progress, my posts will pass through the critical eyes of a native speaker (üëã[Tam](https://github.com/tamarasaurus)).
The second thing about writing in English is expanding the reach of my articles a little more: I obviously don't want to be well known, but if some of my articles can be helpful, let's help more people.

## Kill procrastination

When you have a kid, and when you have a daily job, it's really easy to become less creative/productive during your free time (unless üí§, an activity I've become good at). It's much easier to let the time flow through a good video game, a good show or even worse, a youtube marathon about some obscure subject.

So when the confinement occured, I told myself, no more Twitch, no more YouTube - only a constructive activity (even if it means playing a video game, at least you're making something with a goal.) And thanks to Covid-19 (this is the only case I can say "thank you' to this) I've set myself ready to once again start this website with the whole stack that I wanted to test.

Now the idea is to work on it a little everyday, write words, test code, and share thoughts...

## So what will I talk about ?

I'll talk about things I know, things I like, things I discover, things I experiment with. So we'll talk about product, music, design and a little about code. I'll talk about my family, about my amazing son üêØ and his amazing mum ‚ô•.

See you really soon.

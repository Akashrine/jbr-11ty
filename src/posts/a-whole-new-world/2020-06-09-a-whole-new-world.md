<p class="lead">Who will I cheat ? Launching a website is hard, launching <em>your</em> website is worst. Launching it in 2020 when you're already 35 years old, a dad and 2 loans to refund, needless to say we're flirting with insanity. But there are reasons ! </p>


## Back online

Ok this is my first motivation to relaunch my website. It's been now 12 years since the last time I've been "online", everything has changed a lot but that's part of the fun : __Adaptation__ ðŸ’ª. 

The last time I was online it was because I needed it. I was launching my freelance activity with less than 6 months of experience and only 2 or 3 "contacts". Needless to say the portfolio was a mandatory element ! 

Now I'm not a webdesigner anymore, I've made small changes after small changes to become a [Product Manager](https://linkedin.com/in/julienbrionne). I'll talk about it one day. So the idea is to be back online once again and talk about what i'm working on, what i'm liking and any opinion I'd feel to express. I mean ... it is a blog...

## Experiment code again

In order to go back online I had to restart doing some code and even if it was harder than expected, I had a lot of fun while doing this site. It is obviously not over and we can clearly say it is more of an <abbr data-tooltip title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> than a final version but, as I'd like to go further in development, I keep this site as a great place to experiment (and obviously fail a lot).

## Write ... in english

Even if I'm working in english everyday and feeling confident talking in english, when it comes to write longer posts I lack of vocabulary, I globally suck at using the right tense. As I want to progress my post will pass through the critical eyes of a native speaker (ðŸ‘‹[Tam](https://github.com/tamarasaurus)). 
The second thing about writing in english is enhancing a little more the reach of my articles : I obviously don't want to be well known, but if some of my articles can be helpful, let's help more people.

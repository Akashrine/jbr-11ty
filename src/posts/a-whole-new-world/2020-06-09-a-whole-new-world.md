<p class="lead">Who will I cheat ? Launching a website is hard, launching <em>your</em> website is worst. Launching it in 2020 when you're already 35 years old, a dad and 2 loans to refund, needless to say we're flirting with insanity. But there are reasons ! </p>


## Back online

Ok this is my first motivation to relaunch my website. It's been now 10 years since the last time I've been "online", everything has changed a lot but that's part of the fun : __Adaptation__ ðŸ’ª. 
The last time I was online it was because I needed it. I was launching my freelance activity with less than 6 months of experience and only 2 or 3 "contacts". Needless to say the portfolio was a mandatory element !

<p class="lead"> Launching a personal website in 2020 when you already got more than 10 years of experience is a strange feeling... I'll try explain to you what's my point behind it.</p>

<q>Yeah and ? What about changing your job ?</q>

To be pretty honnest ... it's been now more than 7 years than i'm building, pimping, forgetting then destroying all of my tentatives of getting back online. The reason is ... i've changed my job and I had a small "impostor syndrom" and then I became lazy. So what happened ?

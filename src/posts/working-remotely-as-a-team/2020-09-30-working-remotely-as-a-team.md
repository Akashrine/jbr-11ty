<p class="lead">Heetch has always been a remote-friendly company, even before the crisis situation I was working with a fully distributed team. Now that Covid-19 has forced a lot of persons to work from home, it's time to share a little how we succeed in working remotely. </p>

As the product manager of the customer care team which owns the internal platform, builds the B2B offer and manage the customer care domain (I should talk about DDD one day), I'm facing a lot of issues, talking to a lot of stakeholders, synchronizing with all my peers, following multiple features development. If we were not organized, I'd be drowning under pressure, stress and would be close to burnout. 
Good news for me, I'm not because, we've succeeded as a team to find our organisations and how to balance the nice rhythm of synchrone VS asynchrone. 

Let's talk about **remote work**. 
*NB : This is written in the state of the 14th of October, we're trying to adjust, adapt and evolve continuously our processes*

# What do we need to be efficient

## Strong team trust
Looks pretty obvious but it's one of the hardest challenge to conquer. Usually when going remote, what can happen is the too recurrent question : Do my employees work less now they're home ? The worst result is falling into micro-management for a manager and overcompensate by working too much for employees. The final result is always the same for both : Burnout.

Trust is something really hard to acquire, if you're the type of person to prefer doing something by himself to be sure it is well done, I'm not gonna lie ... it'll be hard. If you're the kind of manager who thinks his reps won't work when at home well it'll be hard too ...
So how to bring trust in remote team ? 

### Transparency
In our team, there's no bad or good news, there's only news. With distance it is REALLY easy to withhold an information or not provide context enough for your teammates. At Buffer, they've put transparency as their first [value](https://buffer.com/about#values) : 
* As individuals, we view transparency as a lifestyle of authenticity and honesty.
* As a team, we view transparency as an effective way to work remotely and establish a culture of trust.
* As a company, we view transparency as a tool to help others.
* We share early in the decision process to avoid “big revelations.”
* We strive to make all communication clear and avoid making assumptions.

So how does it translate on a day to day basics ? Slack is our first tool to communicate altogether. 



### Clear expectations

### Output before number of hours

### Empower





## Over Communication
## Async AND Sync





## Rituals

Just to provide a small context, our team is composed of :
* 1 product manager
* 1 product designer
* 1 engineering manager
* 1 data scientist
* 3 front end developers
* 3 backend developers
* 2 mobile developers

So it makes a lot of people, and all this small world should be able to work in the most autonomous way and whenever they want in the condition they want.

### Delivery weekly meeting
<dl>
    <dt>Time</dt>
    <dd> 1 hour once a week on tuesday</dd>
    <dt>Objective</dt> 
    <dd>Align the team on everything they have to know, from next quarter objectives, next big move in the company, measures, feedback. It's the meeting where everyone has the opportunity to demo his current work to everyone. Init the sprint</dd>
    <dt>Attendees</dt>
    <dd>All the team is in it</dd>
    <dt>What's the structure ?</dt>
    <dd>
        <ul>
            <li>Talk about the news</li>
            <li>outages or big error</li>
            <li>Team status</li>
            <li>Support Leader</li>
            <li>Focus of the week (Delivery and Discovery)</li>
            <li>Monitoring</li>
            <li>Decisions and CTA</li>
            <li>Open Topics</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>Tool used</dt> <dd>Notion with a nice template. The script changes every weeks.</dd>
</dl>

If we had to keep only one it would be this one. It's where everything important is share, where everything is shown.  

### Project Touchpoint
<dl>
    <dt>Time</dt>
    <dd>20 minutes once a week per project (usually 2)</dd>
    <dt>Objective</dt>
    <dd>Small point for the follow-up. What's the status of the loaded task in the sprint, what is blocking and what are the action plan</dd>
    <dt>Attendees</dt>
    <dd>People in the project</dd>
    <dt>What's the structure</dt>

Touchpoints are just a quick way to exchange on an ongoing project, listing call to actions etc ...

    <dt>What's the structure</dt>
    <dd>We're doing it asynchronously. With a Mad / Sad / Glad format on Miro, everyone had post-it, everyone comment on post and try to find call to actions. When we see each other we talked about voted and commented post it and talk about the action points. </dd>
    <dt>Tool used : Miro</dt>

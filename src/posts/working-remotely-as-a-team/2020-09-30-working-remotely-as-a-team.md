<p class="lead">Heetch has always been a remote-friendly company, even before the crisis situation I was working with a fully distributed team. Now that Covid-19 has forced a lot of person to work from home, it's time to share a little what are our process and our methodology and how we applied them remotely. </p>

As the product manager of the customer care team which owns the internal platform, builds the B2B offer and manage the customer care domain (I should talk about DDD one day), I'm facing a lot of issues, talking to a lot of stakeholders, synchronizing with all my peers, following multiple features development. If we were not organized, I'd be drowning under pressure, stress and would be close to burnout. 
Good news for me, I'm not because, we've succeeded as a team to find our organisations and how to balance the nice rhythm of synchrone VS asynchrone. 

Let's talk about our rituals, our process, our methodologies and our tools. 
*NB : This is written in the state of the 30th of september, we're trying to adjust, adapt and evolve continuously our processes*

## Rituals

Just to provide a small context, our team is composed of :
* 1 product manager
* 1 product designer
* 1 engineering manager
* 1 data scientist
* 3 front end developers
* 3 backend developers
* 2 mobile developers

So it makes a lot of people, and all this small world should be able to work in the most autonomous way and whenever they want. 

### Delivery weekly meeting
Time : 1 hour
Objective : Align the team on everything they have to know, from next quarter objectives, next big move in the company, measures, feedback. It's the meeting where everyone has the opportunity to demo his current work to everyone.

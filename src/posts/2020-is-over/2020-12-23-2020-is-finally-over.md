<p class="lead">What a year we must say... When we were talking in december 2019 of this little flu coming from China, nobody knew that would become apocalypse in the modern world. But as I'm not a specialist on geopolitical situation nor on medicinal stuff, I'm going to talk to you about my year.</p>

## A new job

Well I'm glad to say I've spent this all 2020 within : [Heetch](https://www.heetch.com/fr). Maybe the best company I've ever work with. Even if the year was rough for the ride hailing business, I must say the direction really made all the efforts to make us go through all the different challenges we'd face.

Even if the office is not really far from my home, I've spent almost all year working remotely and I've discovered that I was more than pleased to [work in this situation](https://julien-brionne.fr/posts/working-remotely-as-a-team/) . My year was spent on multiple project I'll certainly share more in details in 2021. Focused on the customer care domain, we've touched element like trust, safety, FAQ, feedbacks. 
3 main projects have been touched during this year : 

- Revamping all the Heetch Admin
- Removing 5-Star-ratings system and enhancing feedback experience
- Building the B2B offer



## A new website

At the beginning of 2020 I decided to go back on Front-End and decided to play with Sketch, Photoshop and recently Figma. After 10 years of rebuilding version of my site without releasing it, I've finally succeed into building one that I like. 

If you're interested in how it's done, well you can check the source on [github](https://github.com/Akashrine/jbr-11ty) .

Everything's based on a Static Site Generator called [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) , templating is done in Nunjuck, style is in SCSS and some javascripts here and there. My writting workflow looks like this :

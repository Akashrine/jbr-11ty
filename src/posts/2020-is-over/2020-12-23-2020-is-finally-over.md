<p class="lead">What a year we must say... When we were talking in december 2019 of this little flu coming from China, nobody knew that would become apocalypse in the modern world. But as I'm not a specialist on geopolitical situation nor on medicinal stuff, I'm going to talk to you about my year.</p>

## A new job

Well I'm glad to say I've spent this all 2020 within : [Heetch](https://www.heetch.com/fr). Maybe the best company I've ever work with. Even if the year was rough for the ride hailing business, I must say the direction really made all the efforts to make us go through all the different challenges we'd face.

Even if the office is not really far from my home, I've spent almost all year working remotely and I've discovered that I was more than pleased to [work in this situation](https://julien-brionne.fr/posts/working-remotely-as-a-team/) . My year was spent on multiple project I'll certainly share more in details in 2021. Focused on the customer care domain, we've touched element like trust, safety, FAQ, feedbacks. 
3 main projects have been touched during this year : 

- Revamping all the Heetch Admin
- Removing 5-Star-ratings system and enhancing feedback experience
- Building the B2B offer



## A new website

At the beginning of 2020 I decided to go back on Front-End and decided to play with Sketch, Photoshop and recently Figma. After 10 years of rebuilding version of my site without releasing it, I've finally succeed into building one that I like. 

If you're interested in how it's done, well you can check the source on [github](https://github.com/Akashrine/jbr-11ty) .

Everything's based on a SSG ^[A **static site generator** is a software application that creates HTML pages from templates or components and a given content source.] called [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) , templating is done in Nunjuck, style is in SCSS and some javascripts here and there. There's no CMS behind it even if I'd like to try [stapi](https://strapi.io/) as an headless CMS. 

So what's the idea behind a static site generator ? 



My writting workflow looks like this : 

- Writing article in markdown with [Typora](https://typora.io/) 
- Generating post in Eleventy 
- Git push 
- Netlify magic 
- Voil√† ! 

It was really a challenge to keep my motivation up after finishing the design and the code. 


## Side Projects

Being a dad, having a lot of hobbies don't leave me with a lot of extra times but when I find some I usually try to do everything in a row, .  It's hard for me to go to the bed early and it's making me anxious to go to bed without "creating" something. So usually I end up doing some small code project, or some unnecessary design or create some music I'm not really finishing. 

This 2020 being over, 2021 will be about having in mind a project for every stuff I'd like to experiment with. So here's what I'd like to do : 

Combining music and design : 

* Creating a soundtrack for a false movie 
* Creating the poster for this same false movie

Code + Design + Music : 

* Create a small webapp listing all your favorite artists with their most listened music and trying to link some third parties to access lyrics etc ... 

Design

* I'm trying to enhance my knowledge on the really amazing free tool Figma by doing a infographic on my musical taste. 



## Family

Even if this year was hard on everyone, that a lof of bad stuff happened, I have one good news on this subject, I'll be a dad for the second time in May 2021 !

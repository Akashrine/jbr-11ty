   It is, nowadays, quite common to hear about doing an MVP when you're in the wonderful world of product management. Used as a key word to say "we want to go live asap" it is usually badly used or worst badly done. As everyone was using the MVP words, we came with new fancy accronym : MLP, MMP, RAT, SLC ...

## What are we talking about
MVP is the idea that you should build the smallest amount of product that will provide enough value for your identified user and __then__ you add more and more features. 
<q>“If you are not embarrassed by your first product, you launched too late.” <small>Reid Hoffman</small></q>
Pro MVP are saying that building the smallest amount will help you find out what features your users really want, and assuring that you're building only the right ones. Anti-MVP will tell us that a MVP is just an unfinished product that no one will love and that will stay in this state forever. 

As a reminder, MVP is usually this : 
* __Learning__ : You're here to validate ideas : What are we trying to learn ?
* __Iterate__ : You're MVP will evolve fastly after each learnings
* __Viable__ : Why is everyone forgetting that the V in MVP is viable. It is nice to be fast, but if it's crap ...
* __Minimum__ : One of the hardest part, you have to come with the least number of features in order to stay reliable. 

MVP is built on a serie of iteration that we call "build-mesure-learn". 

As people weren't convince by the efficience of this 3 letters, they come with a lot of fancy new accronyms such as : 

__MLP__ (Minimum Lovable Product) : The idea is to make your product instantly lovable by people, meaning you're playing on an emotional level. As opposed as the MVP your launching your most important features first, not the primoridial one. 

__RAT__ (Riskiest Assumption Test) : Test directly your most dangerous assumption. Once again it's about build, mesure and learn but more in this order : 
* Learn
* Mesure
* Build fast

__SLC__ (Simple, Lovable, Complete) : This one's more subtle. It's like an MVP but with a strong emphazes on "Simple" opposed as minimum. The minimum variable is oftenly seen as " we want to ship at this date, what do we cut, what features won't make it". Simple is more about, this features are nice, but can we simplify them. The great thing about Simplicity, is that it can be part of the conversation from the very beginning.

__MMP__ (Minimum marketable product) : To be simple, it's an MVP with more than one iteration ༼ ༎ຶ ෴ ༎ຶ༽

## The MVP of your RAT is an MLP and a SLC

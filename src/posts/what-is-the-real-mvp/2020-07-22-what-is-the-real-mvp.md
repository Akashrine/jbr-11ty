<p class="lead">
   It is quite common nowadays, to hear about doing an MVP when you're in the wonderful world of product or in a startup. Used as a key word to say "we want to go live asap". Unfortunately MVP is usually badly used or worst badly done. As everyone was using the MVP words without really knowing what was behind it, we came with new fancy accronym : MLP, MMP, RAT, SLC... But in the end, we talk about MVP.

## MVP? What are we talking about?

Before going further, what is and MVP? MVP is oftenly attached to one the most important techniques in lean startup. The minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. (Nice one no ?).  

<blockquote cite="Marty Cagan">
    I have long defined minimum viable product as the smallest possible product that has three critical characteristics: people choose to use it or buy it; people can figure out how to use it; and we can deliver it when we need it with the resources available â€“ also known as valuable, usable and feasible.<br />
    <cite>Marty Cagan, <a href="https://svpg.com/minimum-viable-product/">Minimum Viable Product</a></cite>
</blockquote>

Now what's really complicated is that, even if defining it is quite "easy", understanding it and doing it is much more harder. 
Pro MVP are saying that building the smallest amount will help you find out what features your users really want, and assuring that you're building only the right ones. Anti-MVP will tell us that a MVP is just an unfinished product that no one will love and that will stay in this state forever. 

As a reminder, MVP is usually about this : 
* __Learning__ : You're here to validate ideas : | What are we trying to learn?
* __Iterate__ : You're MVP will evolve fastly after each learnings
* __Viable__ : Why is everyone forgetting that the V in MVP is viable. It is nice to be fast, but if it's crap ...
* __Minimum__ : One of the hardest part, you have to come with the least number of features in order to stay reliable. 

MVP is built on a serie of iterations that we call "build-mesure-learn".

__top line__ : The misconception about iterative and incremental development. It usually is one the main reason for a product to fail. It focuses on the components more than on the problem to be solved. While going closer and closer to the actual user needs. It will last 4 iterations before delivering the actual solution. And before that, your user isn't provided with a viable solution, nor can he provide feedbacks to help evolve your product. While being a way to do product, and while being agile, you don't allow helpful feedbacks from your end user.

__middle line__ : Usually the metaphor stops here by saying : you should do this. Well, this solution is focused on the problem (going from A to B) and provides a chosen solutions every iterations. This solution allows you to validate, and invalidate your hypotheses, to quickly develop a prototype or a proof of concept. 
Proof of concept is interesting to demonstrate an idea, a product, a service or to verify a feasability. However it does not answer the question : "Is this thing valuable for a user". If you deliver a skateboard, does it solve your user real need and problem ? Not really. Is it valuable, usable and a feasible solution. No. Every iteration looks like a new product and not an evolution. While this approach allows for user testing, feedback, and refinement of the solution, it doesnâ€™t address the fact that our user needs a __car__. 

__last line__ : This is how you do an MVP. From iteration 1 to iteration 4 you meet the needs of your end user. Each iteration is an evolution of the previous one. The solution is viable, feasible and usable. More than this, you can "feel" the business model and the strategy behind the product, not just an idea to solve a problem. 


## New accronyms

As people weren't convince by the efficience of this 3 letters (Viable is the hardest one to be understandable), they come with a lot of fancy new accronyms to help redefine what should be an MVP such as : 

__MLP__ (Minimum Lovable Product) : The idea is to make your product instantly lovable by people, meaning you're playing on an emotional level. As opposed as the MVP your launching your most important features first, not the primoridial one. It's usually used when facing an already competiting environment. And it "usually" comes after your mvp. 

__RAT__ (Riskiest Assumption Test) : Test directly your most dangerous assumption. Once again it's about build, mesure and learn but more in this order : 
* Learn
* Mesure
* Build fast

__SLC__ (Simple, Lovable, Complete) : This one's more subtle. It's like an MVP but with a strong emphazes on "Simple" opposed as minimum. The minimum variable is oftenly seen as " we want to ship at this date, what do we cut, what features won't make it". Simple is more about, this features are nice, but can we simplify them. The great thing about Simplicity, is that it can be part of the conversation from the very beginning.

__MMP__ (Minimum marketable product) : To be simple, it's an MVP with more than one iteration. An MVP without the shame of it. 

## The MVP of your RAT is an MLP and a SLC

Long story short, all of this new accronyms only exist because MVP suffers from its celebrity. MVP is used so much itâ€™s lost its original meaning. It's mistakenly applied to refer to the first release of a *rudimentary* product. As a result, the term MVP has ended up becoming much more complex than the quick test it was supposed to be and far too badly done for a released product.

I'm not saying there's no differences between all of this _method_ i'm just saying that : YES we need to start small somewhere before going full release. It's about gathering information, test assumptions, test adoption etc. But where the people are oftenly wrong is that they underestimate the "viability" of their product. 

So, instead of searching for the MVP vs SLC vs RAT vs MLP winner, focus on building a great MVP by following the right path. And by right path, it does not mean by taking shortcuts, but by taking consideration of what is indispensable to make at this point and what should be left for later. MVP is a collection of features necessary to create value for customers. And doing that demand a HUGE effort, which is definitely not below-average. 


## So? | What features should I put in my first release?

__This__, is the fundamental question you should spend time on. There're 3 things that make this question hard to answer : 
* We don't know what features our users will love until they get their hand on the actual product (ðŸ™€)
* Users want everything, NOW !! 
* MVP is not something you're doing quite often (a.k.a We kind of suck by not having enough experiences)

Then you got other outside element making your mvp more difficult to define : 
* Competitors
* Money
* Time 

To give echo to my previous article ([It is not about the solution](https://www.julien-brionne.fr/posts/it-is-not-about-the-solution/)), in order to know what features you want to put in your MVP. 
You have to be sure on :
* | What problem do you want to solve?
* Who is having the problem? 
* How big is the problem? 
* Your value statement (Uniquement value proposition) (| What is YOUR answer on THIS problem?)

And more than everything you must know __what your CORE product is__.

It is really important to understand and know what is your CORE product. By doing a must-have / nice to have or any tool you prefer to prioritize features, you should keep focus on your CORE material, only what brings value to the users by solving their problem. 

Be careful with this "core" logic. It doesn"t mean your feature must be stripped-down, you have to keep in mind that every selected features must be complete, viable and with a great UX. Be careful with the "minimal" in MVP. 
In order to be a *must have* feature, it should be a feature that, if not done, could destroy the journey of an user.

## Don't forget the learning part! 



Main advantages of an mvp are : 
* __Insights__ : Gather them all !! MVP will provide you a lot of feedbacks from your users and the way they use your product.
* __value proposition__ (core product adjustment) : If you're not sure yet of your value proposition, the MVP will help you focus on what's really your core product
* __shared creation__ : By involving your customers, you can get helps on what to do next, what's the most prioritize features, how their problems is evolving ...
* __Evolutions__ : Reduce time to take decision on what to develop and what to delete in terms of features
* __Increase Time to market__ : Well this one's pretty obvious.

You're here to get feedbacks from your customer, so when setting what features should go in the MVP, you should also prepare an analysis plan on what you want to track, what KPIs you're following to know if you're going in the right direction or not. It could be as simple as a landing page of your upcoming product and you just measure the number of leads.


## In short

* MVP are hard to do 
* the M and the V are oftenly misunderstood
* You have to know where you're going even when doing the MVP
* Proof of concept / Prototype â‰  MVP
* You don't care about the accronym

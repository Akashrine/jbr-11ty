<p class="lead">We often hear : Product Manager must be good at solving problems, find solutions, think in advance what will be the product, create amazing features. Well that's not really true. </p>

## Learn by failing 

When I started being a product manager, I was obsessed by creating stuffs, designing solutions, digging into technical details and finding amazing features for users. I thought I was doing really good... But one day I faced a customer who told me : "This features looks really great but I don't need it". That was my first learning. 

Then I tried to get more involved into finding problems. I still remember saying to some co-worker "stop thinking solutions, what is their problem ?". But in reality I was kind of lying to myself. <q>Failure is not the opposite of success it's part of success</q>
Yes I was looking for problems, but it was just a starting point to get back directly to the solution. 

As usual you essentially learn in life by failing, and it is important to succeed your fail.

## Problem oriented VS Solution oriented

Jumping on solution, thinking too much about answering the problem or worse thinking too much about how to do the solution can be a huge blocker and can make your product really go far from its real goals. 
Simple exemple : I was talking with a friend and he told me that one of his company product last feature was not used. His PM told him 

> -well we should communicate more on this feature !
> -Ok and so what will make them use it more ? 
> -They'll be aware of the feature ...

Looks interesting ... if you want more people to see the feature, but what about __using it__ ? 
The real subject is to understand why they don't use is. Worst thing that can happen is digging and finding the feature is not used because no one need it, it doesn't solve __anything__. 

I think a good product manager is able to solve the right problem before solving the problem right. 

## Managing Problems

So what does it mean to manage problems ? 
It is about putting aside any assumptions on the problem you think you solve. Of course you have your own feeling on what's a big issue VS what's a tiny problem, but globally you have stay outside the box. 
What is important to do when facing an issue, is taking rest. I'm not talking about having a nap, but step aside. WHY ? Because our brain has a lot of difficulty to "avoid" solution. When you see a problem you always thought at many funky ways to solve it. 

### Define the problem

The [__confirmation bias__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) can occur in a lot of kind of research, but by taking the problem mindset you should reduce the risk to only filter information that only confirm you hypothesis. 
Defining the problem is usually done by answering some question and by doing an Opportunity Assesment. 

Globally you have to : 

1. Establish the need for a solution :
   1. What is the basic need ?
   2. What is the outcome ?
   3. Who's our customer target (or Persona) ?
2. Define the why :
   1. Is it in the company goal ? aligned with your strategy ?
   2. What is the company outcome / desire ?
3. Set the contextualization of the problem :
   1. What other have tried ?
   2. What have you already tried (if you did) ?
   3. What are the impacts, the constraints ?
4. Write down the final statement of the problem :
   1. Is it only ONE problem ?
   2. What are the requirements ?
   3. What are the key metric we want to measure ?
   4. How do you measure the success of the metrics ?
   5. Define goals / Define non-goals

You should have a better understanding of your problem and as you can see, we haven't yet touch the How. Now it's a matter of __breaking down__ the problem. 

### Breakdown the problem in issues

I'm used to say : one problem at the time. It is the same that in Mathematics : Factorization. The idea is to obtain smaller and more precise problem of that big problem. There's a lot of methodology to do this : 

* fishbone
* 5 why
* Lean Canvas 

All of this help you finding your root/core problem(s) and its baby brothers.

It's important to have smaller part of an issue for 3 reasons :
1. Parallelisation of dev
2. Ease to define a MVP (minimum viable product) or a more fancy RAT (Riskiest Assumption and test)
3. Easier to go deeper in your main problem by digging in every small aspects of it




### Prioritize the issues

I'll write an article on prioritization because it is a deep subject. There are several types of prioritization along the Product Process: Insights Prioritization, Prioritization between projects, Prioritization within projects. 
 Here i'm not talking about prioritizing all you problems but prioritizing the issues you've split from the problem we're breaking down. 

(insert image priorization Primary Research / Secondary Research)

There's once again a lot of methodology about prioritizing : 

* Use of matrix 
* [RICE](https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/) (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effot)
* [SIEVE Checklist](https://engineering.brigad.co/how-we-prioritize-features-at-brigad-the-sieve-checklist-de8c2b18d12a)
* [Priority Scorecard](https://danielelizalde.com/product_management_scorecard/) (custom criteria)



## Then Solution : the winning tryptic 

I have the chance to work in a [company](https://heetch.com) where I'm surrounded by amazing colleagues with the right roles and mission :
* An [Engineering Manager](https://twitter.com/DavidGuyon) (EM)
* A [Product Designer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elodiemermet/) (PD)
